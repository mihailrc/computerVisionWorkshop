Slides:
- Show of hands:
	- How many of you can write code
	- How of you are familiar with the term: AI/ML/Deep Learning
	- How many of you think using video to counting vehicles is an easy problem?
- Goals
	- Lean how to solve Computer Vision problems 
	- Use provided toolkit to experiment and ...
	- Apply what you learned to solve your own problems
- Traditional Programming vs ML
	- Manually write the logic. Input + Rules => Outputs
	- What if problem is so hard you cannot write the rules?
		- Learn from data
		- Inputs + Outputs => Model (or Rules)
- AI/ML/Deep Learning
	- AI - create intelligent machines that can simulate thinking capability and behavior. E.g robotics
	- ML - subset of AI that allow machines to learn from data without being programmed explicitly. Eg. predicting product preferences.
	- Deep Learning - subset of ML that uses complex artificial neural networks. ML features manually created, in DL features are automatically extracted. E.g. image classification or generating images from a description
- Quiz: Deep Learning, ML, AI or Traditional Programming?
	- Lane Detection 
	- Path Planning
	- Behavioral Cloning Video
	- Vehicle Detection
- Biggest Challenge
	- Images/video represent unstructured data that is hard to analyze and interpret automatically. 
	- What  can be done about it? How do we turn unstructured information into structured? 
- How Computers learn to recognize objects
	- video 
- Our problem
	- Find out vehicle count from a video of highway traffic
	- We will solve this problem step by step - show our video
- YOLO
	- basic intro to YOLO
	- how it works
- Coding: Building block 1 -  Detection algorithm
	- Coding: input image -> outputs: identified objects, bounding boxes, confidence scores
	- Trained Models
	- Performances: CPU vs GPU
	- Configuration parameters
- Coding: Building block 2 -  Open CV
	- write text, boxes
	- use image from previous step. Draw boxes, analyze results
	- transformations, bird's eye view  - maybe skip?
- Object detection on video
	- frames are independent. How do you relate objects across frames?
- Coding: Object tracking
	- Challenges
	- Different types of models
	- Kalman Filters
	- Tuning parameters
- Coding: Vehicle Counts
	- Think about how to implement the solution
	- code walkthrough
- Coding: Vehicle Counts per lane
- Coding: Vehicle Counts per vehicle type - maybe skip?
- Discussion or coding: 
	- Calculate vehicle speed
	- Traffic flow analytics
- Custom model - use existing data
	- Start with existing model if you can find one
	- Train the model
	- Evaluate the model
- Custom model - annotate your own data
	- Image annotations
	- Data format
- Active Learning
	- improve model overtime
	- adapt to changes
